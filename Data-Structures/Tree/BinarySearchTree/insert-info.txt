****** Inserting elements into a Binary Search Tree(BST) ******

- BST elements must be "comparable" so that we can order 
  them inside the tree.

- When inserting an element we want to compare its value to 
  the value stored in the current node we're considering to 
  decide on one of the following:

    - Recurse down left subtree        (< case)
    - Recurse down right subtree       (> case)
    - Handle finding a duplicate value (= case)
    - Create a new node                (found a null leaf)
