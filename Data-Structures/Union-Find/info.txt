****** Union Find ****** 

Disjoint Sets: 
    In mathematics, two sets are sid to be disjoint sets if 
    they have no elements in common.

- What is Union Find?
    "Union Find" is a data-structure that keeps track of elements
    which are split into one or more disjoint sets.

    It has two primary operations:
        1. Find
        2. Union

- Where is a Union Find user?
    - Krushal's minimum spanning tree algorithm
    - Grid percolation
    - Network connectivity
    - Least common ancestor in trees
    - Image processing

 - Complexity
    
    α(n) - Amortized constant time
    
    Essentially amortised time means "average time taken per 
    operation, if you do many operations".
