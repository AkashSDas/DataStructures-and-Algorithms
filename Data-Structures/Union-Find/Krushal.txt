- Union Find Applications:
    Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree

    Given a graph G = (V, E) we want to find a "Minimum Spanning 
    Tree" in the graph (it may not be unique). A minimum spanning 
    tree is a subset of the edges which connect all vertices in the 
    graph with the minimal total edge cost.
    
    - This can be done in three steps:

        Setp1 - Sort edges by ascending edge weight.
        Setp2 - Walk through the sorted edges and look at the two 
                nodes the edge belongs to, if the nodes are already 
                unified we don't inculde this edge, otherwise we 
                include it and unify the nodes.
        Setp3 - The algorithm terminates when ever edge has been 
                processed or all the vertices have been unified.
