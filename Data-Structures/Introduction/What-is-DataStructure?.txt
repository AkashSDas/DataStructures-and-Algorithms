*** What is Data Structure? ***

- As per Wikipedia:    
    In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, 
    management, and storage format that enables efficient access 
    and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection 
    of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or 
    operations that can be applied to the data.
    
- In simple terms:
    A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used 
    effectively and efficiently.
==================================
*** Why Data Structure? ***
    
- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
- They help to manage and organize data
- They make code cleaner and easier to understand

*** Computational Complexity Analysis ***

- Common Questions of Good Programmers:
    1. How much time does this algorithm need to finish?
    2. How much space does this algorithm need for its computation?
