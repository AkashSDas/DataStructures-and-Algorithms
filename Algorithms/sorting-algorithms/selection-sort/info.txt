****** Time Complexity of Selection Sort Algorithm ******

- We can easily get the time complexity by examining the for loops in 
  the Selection Sort algorithm. 

- For a array with n elements, the outer loop iterates n times. The 
  inner loop iterate n-1 when i is equal to 1, and then n-2 as i is equal 
  to 2 and so forth.

- The amount of comparisons are (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1, which gives 
  the Selection Sort a time complexity of O(n^2).

  Since, Sum = n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1 
            = n(n-1)/2
